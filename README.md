# Base
## All-in-one platform to consume, create, grow & monetize content with NFT memberships.

##  Description:
This project is a platform built on Lens where creators can have fans convert from short form content fans (think TikTok) to long form content fans (think Youtube) to paid community members (think Patreon) all in one place. 

We use NFTs to create memberships for fans to purchase and allow creators to monetize with other NFT assets like collectibles, content as NFTs, fractional revenue share, etc.

## How It's Made
- Polygon: Generate NFT rewards as memberships + other NFT assets
- Lens: Creator Analytics Dashboard 
- IPFS/Filecoin: Store all creator content (video, audio, text)
- Metamask: Allow fans to purchase from creators
- The Graph: Store user data off chain
